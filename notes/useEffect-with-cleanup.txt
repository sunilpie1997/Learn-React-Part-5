useEffect hook - cleanup

->  we should cancel subscriptions (for example - remove event listeners) whenenver they are not required

    to prevent memory leak

->  we can perform this using 'componentWillUnmount' in class components.

->  ex: ClassMouse.js


->  suppose you want to mimic 'componentWillUnmount' in functional components,

    we can add return statement to the function passed as parameter in UseEffect Hook to achieve this.

->  ex: ClassMouse.js vs HookMouse.js
