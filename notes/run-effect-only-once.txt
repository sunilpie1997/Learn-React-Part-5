UseEffect Hook -> run effect only once

->  suppose we want to mimic only the 'componentDidMount' method in functional component,

    which get's executed only only once, we can do that by using useEffect Hook by
    
    passing empty dependence array as second parameter

    ex: ClassMouse.js vs HookMouse.js
