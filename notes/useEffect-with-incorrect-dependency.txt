UseEffect with incorrect dependency

-> There is some confusion regarding this title. It shows that to 

    update state based on previous value, use setCount(prevState=>prevState+1).

    Also if have added 'count' in dependency array, would that create 'interval' variable everytime

    'count' changes?
    

->  IntervalClassCounter.js

->  IntervalHookCounter.js
