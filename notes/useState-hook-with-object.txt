using UseState hook with object

    ->  ex: HookCounterThree.js

    ->  NOTE: the setter function provided by useState hook works differently when
        compared to setState function.

        The former does not automatically merge and update object

        ex: const [name,setName]=useState({firstName:"",lastName:""})

            setName({firstName:"sunil"})

            On executing above code:

            expectation --->    name={firstName:"sunil",lastName=""}

            reality ---->   name={firstName="sunil"} --->   'lastName' property is removed from 'name' object
